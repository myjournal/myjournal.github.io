# My Story

## Introduction

I decided to write down the history of my life mainly because I couldn't sleep at night.  I frequently wake up in the middle of the night rehashing old memories and never end up going back to sleep.  Awake in the middle of the night, it feels like my brain keeps replaying moments of my life so that I won't forget them.  I am hoping that if I write them down I won't have to try to remember them in the middle of the night.

I doubt my life story is of any interest to anyone on the internet, but maybe someday my children or grandchildren will find some interesting tidbits.

## Quick Bio

I was born in 1979 in a suburb of Minneapolis, Minnesota.  I am the oldest of six children.  I am married to a beatiful wife and I have three amazing children.
