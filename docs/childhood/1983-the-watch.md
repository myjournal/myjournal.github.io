# The watch

My kids love this story about me so I thought I would add it.

When I was around 4 years old there was some flooding in our area.  My parents had taken me to a park, and there was a barrier by the park that was holding back the flood waters.  While exploring I found a wristwatch sitting on the barrier.  I showed it to my mom and she instructed me to put it back where I found it.

I'm not sure what was going through my mind, but I think I just wanted to see what would happen if I threw it into the water, so I threw it.  Maybe to me it was no different than throwing a rock into the water, but my mom helped me understand that I destroyed someone's property.  My kids tell the story with my mom saying "You get a spanking when you get home!" but I'm not sure how accurate that is.
