# Coca-Cola

When I was in college I did not work during the school year.  For 3 summers during college I worked for Coca-Cola.

I was a "driver's helper" which meant that I would go with the drivers that had the biggest loads to deliver that day to help them with their deliveries.  Many times I would help the 2 busiest drivers for a day, helping one in the morning and then driving to the second one in the afternoon.

The work was very hard - there was a lot of lifting and carrying product over curbs or up and down stairs.  We typically delivered to small stores, gas stations, and restaurants.
