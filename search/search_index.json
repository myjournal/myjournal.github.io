The dreams that I do remember are more like stories because I do not \"see\" anything when I am dreaming - my dreams are like someone is narrating a story in my mind. The stories that happen in my dreams feel very real to me - much like someone telling a spooky story can make people feel dread and fear, or a good narrator reading a book can make you feel like you are a part of the book. Up until I was around 35 years old I never realized that other people can experience dreams visually - until I read this article written by the co-founder of the Firefox web browser Much of the article rang true to me - especially the fact that I never once considered that people could actually visualize things in their minds. If someone asks me what my wife looks like, I need to rely on facts that I have memorized about her appearance - I cannot conjure up a picture of her in my mind and relay what I am \"seeing\". If someone asks me to describe the building where I work, I would need to recall facts about my office building and share those facts. It always amazed me when my wife could rattle off the eye-colors of everyone we know, which I now know is because she can \"see\" them in her mind and tell me the color of their eyes based on what she is \"seeing\". For me, unless I commit the color of someone's eyesight to memory, much like memorizing their phone number, I will never be able to tell you the color of their eyes. One interesting aspect to me is that I am fully able to recognize people, so I know my brain must have some kind of visual memory - I just am not able to access that visual memory. Aphantasia is not really an official name for a disorder - there has not been much research on the topic. Aphantasia is basically the condition where people are unable to visualize things in their minds - it is the absence of fantasy - aphantasia. Reading the article by Blake Ross made me realize that as long as I can remember, I have never been able to visualize anything in my mind. It also clicked for me why my dreams never seemed to be like other people's dreams. In the past, when people used to tell me to picture an object, I never realized they were assuming I could actually picture it - because I always assumed they were like me, and picturing something was \"code\" for recalling the facts about it. Another difference I learned was the way my wife spells words compared to how I spell words. She says that when she spells a word she pictures the word in her mind, like she is looking at a dictionary, and just \"reads\" the letters that she sees. I have to rely on my memory - my memory of all of the rules (\"I before E except after C\" for example) or simply memorize the order of the letters that make up a word - much like multiplication tables. Most people have memorized their multiplication tables - I have also memorized the letters of many words. It also became clear to me why I have such a hard time remembering the name of someone I just met as well as what they look like. I am introverted, so being in a situation with unfamiliar people already has my brain working full time When I meet someone new it is hard for me to memorize facts about them as well as make sure I am not being socially awkward. I could meet someone, have a 5-minute conversation with them, turn around to go somewhere else and within 2 seconds not be able to tell you what color their hair or eyes were, what their name was, or very little of what we talked about. Since my brain is diverting a lot of its effort to the social setting, it becomes very difficult for me to catalog the facts about people. On that note, if the social setting is more relaxed and I meet someone new, my mind is dividing work on having a conversation with them, but also memorizing facts about them. I have a better chance of remembering their name or characteristics about them if I am more relaxed. Another interesting setting for me is people-watching. If I have nothing to do, just sitting on a bench watching people walk by, I could tell you all about the people that walked by me for the past 15 minutes: hair colors, clothing, family members, etc. I think this is because my brain isn't multitasking with other social tasks - it is purely focused on observing and cataloging facts.

I was in 9th grade and I remember going to the Mall of America with a couple of friends and wandering around for the day. My mom was gone for the weekend so when I got home I told my dad I was home and went down to bed. In the middle of the night I woke up shaking uncontrollably. My body was shaking so hard I wasn't able to walk up the stairs so I crawled up the two flights of stairs to wake up my dad. He gave me some Tylenol and put me back to bed. February 12, 1995 The next morning I was having trouble breathing and I was too weak to get out of bed. My mom came home sometime in the middle of the day, took one look at me, and immediately took me to the hospital. The nurses performed the normal checks on me - I think the only thing they discovered at that point was that I was running a fever. Since I was having trouble breathing they sent me down for chest x-rays. When the x-rays came back there was nothing significant revealed. I was starting to feel much worse so they admitted me to the hospital and brought me to a room. I remember that first room was a quarantine room with two sets of doors. I don't know if that was the only open room they had or if they put me in that room because they didn't know what was wrong with me yet. They tried to set me up with an IV but at that point I was very dehydrated so they had a lot of trouble finding a vein they could use. At the same time they sent lab techs in to take blood samples. This would be the beginning of a daily onslaught of lab techs coming into my room to collect blood, multiple times a day. They needed another chest x-ray but since I was too weak to move they brought a portable x-ray machine to my room. I remember it being somewhat comical because they had to get the machine through the double doors of my quarantine room. The x-rays came back inconclusive again since I was still not hydrated enough for anything to be revealed. They decided to wait until the next day to do another round of x-rays, hoping that I would be hydrated enough. Pneumonia The next few days are very foggy in my memory. They were giving me a lot of pain killers and I was on oxygen because I was having a very hard time breathing. They brought the portable x-ray machine again and took another set of chest x-rays. Finally, I was hydrated enough for the x-rays to reveal that I had pneumonia on my right lung. The x-rays also revealed that my right lung was completely collapsed, which explained the acute pain I was experiencing while breathing. They moved me to a new room and I believe that was my room until the day I left. Antibiotics Up until this point they may have had me on general antibiotics but now that they knew I had pneumonia they worked to get me started on a stronger antibiotic. The main problem they were facing was that I have allergic reactions to ampicillin, penicillin, and amoxicillin. I do not remember what the solutions were, but whatever antibiotic they chose to give me, it did not help - each day my body weakened and the pain grew stronger. Thoracentesis The reason for the painful, difficult breathing was because of a collapsed lung. The reason my right lung had collapsed was because of a pleural effusion - fluid in the space between my lung and my chest wall. The doctors decided to perform a procedure called thoracentesis - a procedure to drain the fluid from the pleural space around my right lung. This procedure involved the worst physical pain that I have encountered in the course of my life. (Go to the Wikipedia page for thoracentesis and look at the instruments they use to understand why. Do not go there if you are squeamish.) The purpose for the thoracentesis was two-fold: The first was therapeutic, to try to relieve my pain and improve my breathing. The second was to perform laboratory analysis on the fluid. A drawback of the thoracentesis is that the patient needs to be sitting upright and awake. They gave me a drug named Versed ( Midazolam ) to ease my discomfort during the procedure. An devious (in my opinion) side affect of Versed is that it temporarily prevents the patient from creating new memories. This meant that I would be awake for the procedure but not remember the procedure after the drug wore off. This was true for the first thoracentesis, but I had more throughout my stay at the hospital and my body grew resistant to the Versed. I vividly remember the last two procedures and can still \"feel\" the pain when I think about it. Each time they performed the thoracentesis they would take me down for x-rays to view the results. Each time the x-rays came back they discovered that my pleural space was full of fluid again. The procedure offered no therapeutic results. Phlebotomies As mentioned before, I think I had at least two phlebotomies (lab blood samples) done every single day I was there. Some of the teams didn't even coordinate with each other so I remember having someone draw some blood and then a half hour later someone else come to get a blood sample. I have always hated the process of getting my blood drawn and I don't think I ever got used to it while I was there. Heparin locks Another side affect of being in the hospital for so long and needing a constant IV drip was that my veins started to harden (I think? Something was happening with my veins the longer the IV stayed in and made it more difficult for them to start new IVs). They would try to give my veins a break by using heparin to stop my blood from clotting and capping off the catheter on my IV. I dreaded this activity because the shot of heparin would burn and sting my vein and the IV hurt when they re-attached it to the drip. CT scan Sometime during my hospital stay they sent me down for a CT scan so they could get a better picture of my lung. In order to make the image more clear they wanted me to drink a huge bottle of barium. I was barely eating and drinking anything at that point (getting \"fed\" and hydrated via my IV) so drinking that much of any liquid would have been difficult. When it was my turn for the CT scan they strapped me into the machine and explained that during the scans they would tell me to hold my breath at certain points to get my lungs into better positions. Under normal circumstances I could hold my breath for a good amount of time, but after many days of having a collapsed lung, taking a \"big deep breath\" was silly. When they told me to hold my breath, I tried but could only muster a couple of seconds before the pain made me quit. Part way through the scan they told me (from the other room) that they were going to inject iodine into my IV to provide contrast. A few seconds after the iodine entered my blood stream I tasted a metallic taste in my mouth. My illness, the large amount of barium I had consumed, and the horrible taste of metal in my mouth caused me to start vomiting. I tried to turn my head since I was laying on my back, but they had fastened a guide on either side of my head and I was strapped in to provide for a more clear image. This was another low point in my hospital visit. Haircut At about three weeks into my hospital stay my hair started to get pretty shaggy (and since I never got out of bed it was probably a horrible case of bed-head). One of my friends' mom was a barber/hair stylist so she came to my room to cut my hair. I remember being so weak and so out of breath from just sitting in a chair that my hair-cut had to be split into 3 or 4 sessions so I could lay down for a bit before getting back into the chair. She was probably planning on a 15-20 minute hair cut but was there a lot longer. This is a memory that I will never forget. In the middle of my memories of suffering there are bright spots where others showed me love and care. Chest tube One day, during another thoracentesis, the doctor realized that as fast as he was draining fluid, more fluid was entering my pleural space. He decided it would be better to put in a more permanent drainage system in the form of a chest tube. This would be the first time that I went under general anesthesia. When I woke up I had a surgical tube coming out of my chest that ran down to a large white box that collected the fluid. There was a steady flow of fluid for the first few days. If I remember correctly, I believe that 1-2 liters of fluid were drained from my chest cavity each day. Eventually, however, the drainage slowed but the x-rays showed that I still had fluid around my lung. The nurses would routinely \"strip\" my chest tube by pinching the tube near my chest and pulling that closed part down the tube in hopes of freeing any obstructions. This activity would create a suction on the tube that would cause bubbling inside my chest. I have never had such a strange sensation before. School In the mean time, I was missing more and more days of school (although at the time, it wasn't even a thought in my mind). My teachers and classmates started to realize the seriousness of my hospital visit. My homeroom teacher would give updates during homeroom, and my classmates and teachers frequently visited and sent get well cards. It was nice to see friends and have visitors but I was so fatigued from sitting up in my bed that visits could not last long. More chest tubes Eventually the flow of fluid in my chest tube had slowed to a trickle so they decided to put in another chest tube. When I woke up from surgery I now had two tubes coming out of my chest. I seem to remember they were right next to each other. These tubes worked well at first but after a few days, slowed to trickle. The doctors decided to give me a third chest tube. I remember one day I had to go to the bathroom and I was alone in my room (which hardly ever happened). I had my IV on the left side of my bed and the chest tube boxes on the right side of my bed. I had to wheel my IV stand around, pick up my chest tube boxes, and carry everything to the bathroom. It was quite an ordeal and it probably made my mom feel guilty for leaving me. In hindsight, I probably could have just pushed my nurse call button... Surgery This section is fuzzy to me because I was not awake during this time so it is a memory of what my mom told me. I went into surgery for my third chest tube. I the surgeon made an incision a couple of inches lower than my previous tubes and I believe used a scope to view the inside of my chest before inserting the tube. When he viewed the inside of my chest he saw a mass of organized pleural empyema - a collection of pus in the pleural cavity. Note: I read recently that pleural empyema is not revealed on an x-ray (it can't be differentiated from fluid) - an ultrasound can confirm empyema. Upon this discovery he went out and talked to my parents and told them that they needed to do a full operation, open chest, to remove the empyema. Without waking me, I was taken to the operating room. A large incision was made (horizontal, under my right arm) and the muscles and ribs were moved out of the way so the surgeon could get into my chest cavity. He told me afterwards that he had taken 4 large (12-16 ounce) masses of empyema from my chest cavity and drained 1-2 liters of fluid. My body was in shock when I woke up from surgery. I was shaking and I remember being very cold. The nurses kept piling hot blankets on me. I tried to talk but my voice wouldn't work because of the breathing tube that had been in my throat. I came in and out of the post-operation fog and tried to understand as they tried to explain what had happened. I thought I was just going in for another chest tube but I couldn't understand the medical terms they were throwing at me. I remember hot tears running down the sides of my face into my ears and not being able to control it. My chest felt tight. I'm sure my chest cavity was still numb from the medication but I was tightly wrapped in bandages. I don't remember being wheeled in to see my parents but I remember crying when I saw them. The surgeon explained a bit more to me and I started to understand. He showed me one of the masses of empyema - it looked like a big ball of cottage cheese. On a personal note, I remember my surgeon (Dr. William Brennom) being very nice, funny, and compassionate. The surgery he performed on me most likely saved my life, so technically, Dr. Brennom saved my life! A new drug Around the time of the surgery my doctors decided to try a new drug to see if that would improve my condition. The drug was named Biaxin and was relatively new. The Biaxin, along with the surgery started clearing up my pneumonia. Recovery After my surgery I spent a night or two in the ICU while I recovered. I remember a girl in the room next to me had just broken her neck in a car accident. She screamed the whole first night. I remember my throat hurt, my incision was very painful, and the girl's screaming made me scared. That first, sleepless night in the ICU was another horrible memory that I do not think I will ever forget. Eventually I was returned to \"my room\" and it felt more like home. At this point it had been more than 3 weeks since I was admitted into the hospital. The pain on the right side of my chest was nearly unbearable. I have a pretty high pain tolerance, but the pain from that surgery frequently made me cry. They gave me a morphine pump with a button to let me administer a dose. It had a timer on it so I could only press the button every few minutes. I remember a few times watching the timer count down, waiting to push the button as soon as it let me. I think I even asked my mom if they could up the dosage. The worst part of the recovery was when I needed to sneeze or cough (which was a lot). My lung had been collapsed for almost a month and there was a lot of blood and fluid in my lung. I would wince and try to hold back the coughs but the nurses said I needed to let them happen to proceed with my recovery. A trick I learned to help with the pain when coughing was to clutch a pillow under my right arm and squeeze it against my ribs. That seemed to alleviate some of the pain. The nurses also told me that the coughing wasn't enough to help my lung recover, so they gave me an evil device called a peak flow meter . I had to inhale as deep as I could (with my newly inflated lung) and exhale as hard as I could into the peak flow meter, which would measure the maximum speed I could exhale. When I got to go home they sent it home with me to use multiple times a day and strengthen my lung. Bathrooms Before I tell the story of when professional football players came to visit me, I need to give some background information on my bathroom habits while I was in the hospital. Most of the time I was too weak to get out of bed. Sometimes I could muster the strength to get out of bed when I needed to go to the bathroom, but I was under orders to urinate in a container so they could measure and test my urine. Since I wasn't able to use a toilet and it took so much effort and caused so much pain to get out of bed, I usually stayed in my bed and urinated in the container instead of getting up to do it. The fact that some days I wasn't physically able to get out of bed, the fact that I rarely went into the bathroom, the fact that I was taking a lot of strong medications, the fact that I wasn't eating hardly anything - of of these things pretty much caused my intestines to stop. I guess I'm thankful I didn't have to take care of that business in bed somehow (I don't even want to know) but a harsh result of a month of being stopped up was that as I made my recovery they started giving me a lot of laxatives. This is the backstory to the next section. Warren Moon One of the later days of my hospital stay I was finally up and walking around. The nurses came in and told me that a few of the Minnesota Vikings NFL players were visiting kids who had been in the hospital for a while. I was excited to meet them, but I was also feeling very nauseated because of all of the laxatives I was on. I remember going in and out of the bathroom all day because my intestines were going crazy, but when I would try to go, I couldn't. Sure enough, I was in the bathroom, feeling awful, when Warren Moon , the quarterback of the MN Vikings came into my room. He politely talked with my mom (I'm not sure where she told him I was) for a while and then had to go. I completely missed meeting him because I didn't want to play chicken with my intestines. March 11, 1995 Exactly one month after being admitted to the hospital, I was released on March 11, 1995. I was very weak, sore, and emotional, but I was very happy to be heading home. My mom I can't look back on my month in the hospital without remembering everything my mom did for me. I think my mom stayed with me almost every single day I was there - even nights. I was very shy about speaking up for myself and she was my advocate. She tirelessly took care of me and watched out for my well being. My friends I also can't look back on my month in the hospital without remembering the outpouring of love from my classmates. There was a steady stream of cards, posters, food, flowers, games, and visitors the whole time I was there. I wasn't able to return to school until the end of April but it was amazing to see everyone again. My Grandma When I went in to the hospital I barely weighed 100 pounds. I do not remember how much I weighed when I got out, but I know it was significantly less. My grandma took it upon herself to make sure I was eating right when I got home. She made me drink barely greens, made me stay away from sugar, and constantly asked about my diet. I still joke about my health food regime with her to this day. Conclusion With a lifechanging event like this in my past, I am definitely thankful that I am alive. I think it is easy to take health for granted, and this experience has made me appreciate my life and the lives of my family. I frequently think back on my ordeal in the hospital and it inspires me to thankfulness for the loved ones around me.","title":"The hospital"},{"location":"teen/1995-the-hospital/#the-hospital","text":"","title":"The Hospital"},{"location":"teen/1995-the-hospital/#february-11-1995","text":"The day of February 11, 1995 started out like a normal Saturday for me. I was in 9th grade and I remember going to the Mall of America with a couple of friends and wandering around for the day. My mom was gone for the weekend so when I got home I told my dad I was home and went down to bed. In the middle of the night I woke up shaking uncontrollably. My body was shaking so hard I wasn't able to walk up the stairs so I crawled up the two flights of stairs to wake up my dad. He gave me some Tylenol and put me back to bed.","title":"February 11, 1995"},{"location":"teen/1995-the-hospital/#february-12-1995","text":"The next morning I was having trouble breathing and I was too weak to get out of bed. My mom came home sometime in the middle of the day, took one look at me, and immediately took me to the hospital. The nurses performed the normal checks on me - I think the only thing they discovered at that point was that I was running a fever. Since I was having trouble breathing they sent me down for chest x-rays. When the x-rays came back there was nothing significant revealed. I was starting to feel much worse so they admitted me to the hospital and brought me to a room. I remember that first room was a quarantine room with two sets of doors. I don't know if that was the only open room they had or if they put me in that room because they didn't know what was wrong with me yet. They tried to set me up with an IV but at that point I was very dehydrated so they had a lot of trouble finding a vein they could use. At the same time they sent lab techs in to take blood samples. This would be the beginning of a daily onslaught of lab techs coming into my room to collect blood, multiple times a day. They needed another chest x-ray but since I was too weak to move they brought a portable x-ray machine to my room. I remember it being somewhat comical because they had to get the machine through the double doors of my quarantine room. The x-rays came back inconclusive again since I was still not hydrated enough for anything to be revealed. They decided to wait until the next day to do another round of x-rays, hoping that I would be hydrated enough.","title":"February 12, 1995"},{"location":"teen/1995-the-hospital/#pneumonia","text":"The next few days are very foggy in my memory. They were giving me a lot of pain killers and I was on oxygen because I was having a very hard time breathing. They brought the portable x-ray machine again and took another set of chest x-rays. Finally, I was hydrated enough for the x-rays to reveal that I had pneumonia on my right lung. The x-rays also revealed that my right lung was completely collapsed, which explained the acute pain I was experiencing while breathing. They moved me to a new room and I believe that was my room until the day I left.","title":"Pneumonia"},{"location":"teen/1995-the-hospital/#antibiotics","text":"Up until this point they may have had me on general antibiotics but now that they knew I had pneumonia they worked to get me started on a stronger antibiotic. The main problem they were facing was that I have allergic reactions to ampicillin, penicillin, and amoxicillin. I do not remember what the solutions were, but whatever antibiotic they chose to give me, it did not help - each day my body weakened and the pain grew stronger.","title":"Antibiotics"},{"location":"teen/1995-the-hospital/#thoracentesis","text":"The reason for the painful, difficult breathing was because of a collapsed lung. The reason my right lung had collapsed was because of a pleural effusion - fluid in the space between my lung and my chest wall. The doctors decided to perform a procedure called thoracentesis - a procedure to drain the fluid from the pleural space around my right lung. This procedure involved the worst physical pain that I have encountered in the course of my life. (Go to the Wikipedia page for thoracentesis and look at the instruments they use to understand why. Do not go there if you are squeamish.) The purpose for the thoracentesis was two-fold: The first was therapeutic, to try to relieve my pain and improve my breathing. The second was to perform laboratory analysis on the fluid. A drawback of the thoracentesis is that the patient needs to be sitting upright and awake. They gave me a drug named Versed ( Midazolam ) to ease my discomfort during the procedure. An devious (in my opinion) side affect of Versed is that it temporarily prevents the patient from creating new memories. This meant that I would be awake for the procedure but not remember the procedure after the drug wore off. This was true for the first thoracentesis, but I had more throughout my stay at the hospital and my body grew resistant to the Versed. I vividly remember the last two procedures and can still \"feel\" the pain when I think about it. Each time they performed the thoracentesis they would take me down for x-rays to view the results. Each time the x-rays came back they discovered that my pleural space was full of fluid again. The procedure offered no therapeutic results.","title":"Thoracentesis"},{"location":"teen/1995-the-hospital/#phlebotomies","text":"As mentioned before, I think I had at least two phlebotomies (lab blood samples) done every single day I was there. Some of the teams didn't even coordinate with each other so I remember having someone draw some blood and then a half hour later someone else come to get a blood sample. I have always hated the process of getting my blood drawn and I don't think I ever got used to it while I was there.","title":"Phlebotomies"},{"location":"teen/1995-the-hospital/#heparin-locks","text":"Another side affect of being in the hospital for so long and needing a constant IV drip was that my veins started to harden (I think? Something was happening with my veins the longer the IV stayed in and made it more difficult for them to start new IVs). They would try to give my veins a break by using heparin to stop my blood from clotting and capping off the catheter on my IV. I dreaded this activity because the shot of heparin would burn and sting my vein and the IV hurt when they re-attached it to the drip.","title":"Heparin locks"},{"location":"teen/1995-the-hospital/#ct-scan","text":"Sometime during my hospital stay they sent me down for a CT scan so they could get a better picture of my lung. In order to make the image more clear they wanted me to drink a huge bottle of barium. I was barely eating and drinking anything at that point (getting \"fed\" and hydrated via my IV) so drinking that much of any liquid would have been difficult. When it was my turn for the CT scan they strapped me into the machine and explained that during the scans they would tell me to hold my breath at certain points to get my lungs into better positions. Under normal circumstances I could hold my breath for a good amount of time, but after many days of having a collapsed lung, taking a \"big deep breath\" was silly. When they told me to hold my breath, I tried but could only muster a couple of seconds before the pain made me quit. Part way through the scan they told me (from the other room) that they were going to inject iodine into my IV to provide contrast. A few seconds after the iodine entered my blood stream I tasted a metallic taste in my mouth. My illness, the large amount of barium I had consumed, and the horrible taste of metal in my mouth caused me to start vomiting. I tried to turn my head since I was laying on my back, but they had fastened a guide on either side of my head and I was strapped in to provide for a more clear image. This was another low point in my hospital visit.","title":"CT scan"},{"location":"teen/1995-the-hospital/#haircut","text":"At about three weeks into my hospital stay my hair started to get pretty shaggy (and since I never got out of bed it was probably a horrible case of bed-head). One of my friends' mom was a barber/hair stylist so she came to my room to cut my hair. I remember being so weak and so out of breath from just sitting in a chair that my hair-cut had to be split into 3 or 4 sessions so I could lay down for a bit before getting back into the chair. She was probably planning on a 15-20 minute hair cut but was there a lot longer. This is a memory that I will never forget. In the middle of my memories of suffering there are bright spots where others showed me love and care.","title":"Haircut"},{"location":"teen/1995-the-hospital/#chest-tube","text":"One day, during another thoracentesis, the doctor realized that as fast as he was draining fluid, more fluid was entering my pleural space. He decided it would be better to put in a more permanent drainage system in the form of a chest tube. This would be the first time that I went under general anesthesia. When I woke up I had a surgical tube coming out of my chest that ran down to a large white box that collected the fluid. There was a steady flow of fluid for the first few days. If I remember correctly, I believe that 1-2 liters of fluid were drained from my chest cavity each day. Eventually, however, the drainage slowed but the x-rays showed that I still had fluid around my lung. The nurses would routinely \"strip\" my chest tube by pinching the tube near my chest and pulling that closed part down the tube in hopes of freeing any obstructions. This activity would create a suction on the tube that would cause bubbling inside my chest. I have never had such a strange sensation before.","title":"Chest tube"},{"location":"teen/1995-the-hospital/#school","text":"In the mean time, I was missing more and more days of school (although at the time, it wasn't even a thought in my mind). My teachers and classmates started to realize the seriousness of my hospital visit. My homeroom teacher would give updates during homeroom, and my classmates and teachers frequently visited and sent get well cards. It was nice to see friends and have visitors but I was so fatigued from sitting up in my bed that visits could not last long.","title":"School"},{"location":"teen/1995-the-hospital/#more-chest-tubes","text":"Eventually the flow of fluid in my chest tube had slowed to a trickle so they decided to put in another chest tube. When I woke up from surgery I now had two tubes coming out of my chest. I seem to remember they were right next to each other. These tubes worked well at first but after a few days, slowed to trickle. The doctors decided to give me a third chest tube. I remember one day I had to go to the bathroom and I was alone in my room (which hardly ever happened). I had my IV on the left side of my bed and the chest tube boxes on the right side of my bed. I had to wheel my IV stand around, pick up my chest tube boxes, and carry everything to the bathroom. It was quite an ordeal and it probably made my mom feel guilty for leaving me. In hindsight, I probably could have just pushed my nurse call button...","title":"More chest tubes"},{"location":"teen/1995-the-hospital/#surgery","text":"This section is fuzzy to me because I was not awake during this time so it is a memory of what my mom told me. I went into surgery for my third chest tube. I the surgeon made an incision a couple of inches lower than my previous tubes and I believe used a scope to view the inside of my chest before inserting the tube. When he viewed the inside of my chest he saw a mass of organized pleural empyema - a collection of pus in the pleural cavity. Note: I read recently that pleural empyema is not revealed on an x-ray (it can't be differentiated from fluid) - an ultrasound can confirm empyema. Upon this discovery he went out and talked to my parents and told them that they needed to do a full operation, open chest, to remove the empyema. Without waking me, I was taken to the operating room. A large incision was made (horizontal, under my right arm) and the muscles and ribs were moved out of the way so the surgeon could get into my chest cavity. He told me afterwards that he had taken 4 large (12-16 ounce) masses of empyema from my chest cavity and drained 1-2 liters of fluid. My body was in shock when I woke up from surgery. I was shaking and I remember being very cold. The nurses kept piling hot blankets on me. I tried to talk but my voice wouldn't work because of the breathing tube that had been in my throat. I came in and out of the post-operation fog and tried to understand as they tried to explain what had happened. I thought I was just going in for another chest tube but I couldn't understand the medical terms they were throwing at me. I remember hot tears running down the sides of my face into my ears and not being able to control it. My chest felt tight. I'm sure my chest cavity was still numb from the medication but I was tightly wrapped in bandages. I don't remember being wheeled in to see my parents but I remember crying when I saw them. The surgeon explained a bit more to me and I started to understand. He showed me one of the masses of empyema - it looked like a big ball of cottage cheese. On a personal note, I remember my surgeon (Dr. William Brennom) being very nice, funny, and compassionate. The surgery he performed on me most likely saved my life, so technically, Dr. Brennom saved my life!","title":"Surgery"},{"location":"teen/1995-the-hospital/#a-new-drug","text":"Around the time of the surgery my doctors decided to try a new drug to see if that would improve my condition. The drug was named Biaxin and was relatively new. The Biaxin, along with the surgery started clearing up my pneumonia.","title":"A new drug"},{"location":"teen/1995-the-hospital/#recovery","text":"After my surgery I spent a night or two in the ICU while I recovered. I remember a girl in the room next to me had just broken her neck in a car accident. She screamed the whole first night. I remember my throat hurt, my incision was very painful, and the girl's screaming made me scared. That first, sleepless night in the ICU was another horrible memory that I do not think I will ever forget. Eventually I was returned to \"my room\" and it felt more like home. At this point it had been more than 3 weeks since I was admitted into the hospital. The pain on the right side of my chest was nearly unbearable. I have a pretty high pain tolerance, but the pain from that surgery frequently made me cry. They gave me a morphine pump with a button to let me administer a dose. It had a timer on it so I could only press the button every few minutes. I remember a few times watching the timer count down, waiting to push the button as soon as it let me. I think I even asked my mom if they could up the dosage. The worst part of the recovery was when I needed to sneeze or cough (which was a lot). My lung had been collapsed for almost a month and there was a lot of blood and fluid in my lung. I would wince and try to hold back the coughs but the nurses said I needed to let them happen to proceed with my recovery. A trick I learned to help with the pain when coughing was to clutch a pillow under my right arm and squeeze it against my ribs. That seemed to alleviate some of the pain. The nurses also told me that the coughing wasn't enough to help my lung recover, so they gave me an evil device called a peak flow meter . I had to inhale as deep as I could (with my newly inflated lung) and exhale as hard as I could into the peak flow meter, which would measure the maximum speed I could exhale. When I got to go home they sent it home with me to use multiple times a day and strengthen my lung.","title":"Recovery"},{"location":"teen/1995-the-hospital/#bathrooms","text":"Before I tell the story of when professional football players came to visit me, I need to give some background information on my bathroom habits while I was in the hospital. Most of the time I was too weak to get out of bed. Sometimes I could muster the strength to get out of bed when I needed to go to the bathroom, but I was under orders to urinate in a container so they could measure and test my urine. Since I wasn't able to use a toilet and it took so much effort and caused so much pain to get out of bed, I usually stayed in my bed and urinated in the container instead of getting up to do it. The fact that some days I wasn't physically able to get out of bed, the fact that I rarely went into the bathroom, the fact that I was taking a lot of strong medications, the fact that I wasn't eating hardly anything - of of these things pretty much caused my intestines to stop. I guess I'm thankful I didn't have to take care of that business in bed somehow (I don't even want to know) but a harsh result of a month of being stopped up was that as I made my recovery they started giving me a lot of laxatives. This is the backstory to the next section.","title":"Bathrooms"},{"location":"teen/1995-the-hospital/#warren-moon","text":"One of the later days of my hospital stay I was finally up and walking around. The nurses came in and told me that a few of the Minnesota Vikings NFL players were visiting kids who had been in the hospital for a while. I was excited to meet them, but I was also feeling very nauseated because of all of the laxatives I was on. I remember going in and out of the bathroom all day because my intestines were going crazy, but when I would try to go, I couldn't. Sure enough, I was in the bathroom, feeling awful, when Warren Moon , the quarterback of the MN Vikings came into my room. He politely talked with my mom (I'm not sure where she told him I was) for a while and then had to go. I completely missed meeting him because I didn't want to play chicken with my intestines.","title":"Warren Moon"},{"location":"teen/1995-the-hospital/#march-11-1995","text":"Exactly one month after being admitted to the hospital, I was released on March 11, 1995.
